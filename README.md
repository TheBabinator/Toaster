# Toaster
A mindustry mod that adds cool stuff. 
## Notice:
This mod isn't truly DEAD, I am just waiting for unit factories to be able to accept modded items. If I have missed this and it's already possible, just submit an issue or something.
## Features:
- A full port of TheBabinator/NuclearWar. (funny nukes)
- Steam turbines.
- Fusion energy.
- Pre 3.5 music for literally no reason at all.
